### Vision Statement
To create an open platform where Boulder students and Faculty can publicly share diverse ideas and opinions of each other, and what others think about them as a social experiment

### Application Description
RottenBuffs is an application specifically designed to rate people. Rate your friends, famous people, teachers, and even complete strangers. Login with your buff email to completely trash or love others. The RottenBuffs app will provide functionality to leave ratings for other users as well as view the ratings on your account and any past ratings that you have left. Users will also be able to report any reviews that they believe to be inappropriate for the platform. A review includes a good or bad rating, as well as a description of the reasoning behind the review. Rating is displayed in the person’s profile page as a percentage of good reviews compared to total reviews, together with their profile picture and self made description. 
The website will include functionality to search for specific users to leave reviews for as well as a trending page which will display users who are currently popular on the platform. There will be a my reviews page where the user’s own past reviews will be shown.
