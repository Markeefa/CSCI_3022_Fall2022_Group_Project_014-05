# November 13, 2022 Updates:

## New features:

### Profile Page:

- Upon login, you are redirected to the profile page where you can edit your own profile and see all of your reviews that you have made, any of which you can edit.

### Posting Page:

- If you are logged in, you can post a new item to the database to be reviewed, using a title, image url, category, and description of the item.

### Home Page:

- The home page displays the 10 most recently posted items, which you can review freely.

### Cloudinary API Setup:

- We are connected to the Cloudinary API, which we will use to allow users to upload an image file instead of a url.

## Fixes:

- The Website actually works with the database, last week there were a couple big and annoying bugs that made it simply not functional and not accurately logging in/registering.
- The Website is deployed onto the CU network.
- Dummy data is added for now until you can add reviews.
