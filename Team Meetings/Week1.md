# October 31, 2022 Meeting:

We need to update the Project Board with user stories, we added the Login Page with a checkmark based markup, and we need to add user stories. Every week, each person will have at least one story assigned. We should have the login page, register page, and the partials done this week. Since we are not using an external API, we need to use an external source to host the image, so we only store the url in the database. In the registration page, the user will upload an image for themself, and it should be sent externally and received as a url. 

The user table will have a username, hashed password, photo, and user information. Then, we will have a reviews table with review data, comments, upvote/downvote, etc. We have the freedom to make whatever database we want as long as it is functional and scalable. Make tables that make sense, easy to query/obtain information. Two people can be solely responsible for handling the database tables. Make sure to add dummy data to the database.

We should each have separate branches for each user story. We need meaningful commits, for each business day of the week. Next meeting will be at 7:00 PM, instead of 6:45, as will all future meetings.
